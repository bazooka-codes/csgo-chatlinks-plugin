//This is where links for the wit_chat_links plugin will be stored
//Only lines with "//" at the start will be ignored. Do not use comments unless necessary
//Try to make commands unique if they are common words, to risk collision with other commands
//The '!' is handled internally, do not put '!' before commands
//Usage: the plugin recognizes the "tab" character as delimiter. DO NOT FORGET TAB

//Format: "command name" *tab* "html link"

//Start below this line, with new links going below the last
