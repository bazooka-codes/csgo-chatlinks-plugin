# A Chat-Links Plugin for CS:GO
![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/bazooka-codes/csgo-chatlinks-plugin/total)

This is an extremely simple plugin that reads from a .txt file and will dynamically add commands to chat that will print
links to clients in chat and in console. Clients can type !links in in-game chat and the plugin will provide a menu to 
select links that will print in chat. These links and menu items are defined in the chat_links.txt file.

## Usage
All files are in their proper directories. The only thing you need to do is move them onto your server version. In terms
of adding links, do not modify the plugin code. You only need to add your links (in the proper format) to the 
configs/chat_links.txt file. The plugin will automatically refresh the links on map change.

## WiT Gaming Version
This means that the plugin has WiT branding and WiT specific features included. It works the same but may have unwanted
features for general-use. If you would like your own brand included in the  plugin, contact me via pull request or 
by email: bazookaforreal@gmail.com.
