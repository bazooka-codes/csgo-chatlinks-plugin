# A Chat-Links Plugin for CS:GO
![Github All Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/bazooka-codes/csgo-chatlinks-plugin/total)

This is an extremely simple plugin that reads from a .txt file and will dynamically add commands to chat that will print
links to clients in chat and in console.

## WiT Gaming Version
This means that the plugin has WiT branding and WiT specific features included. It works the same but may have unwanted
features for general-use. If you would like your own brand included in the  plugin, contact me via pull request or 
by email: bazookaforreal@gmail.com.

## Compiling
Directories:

wit_chat_links.smx - SourceMod\addons\sourcemod\plugins (after compiling)

wit_chat_links.sp - SourceMod\addons\sourcemod\scripting

With the files in the right directories, and with Multicolors(https://github.com/Bara/Multi-Colors) installed, compiles 
the default way.
